              The priest Hsiang-yen said, "It is as though you were up in a tree hanging from a branch by your teeth. You hands grasp no branch, your feet rest on no limb."

            <p>
              Someone approaches underneath the tree and asks, "What is the meaning of Bodhidharma's coming from the West?"

            <p>
              If you don't answer, you shirk your duty.

            <p>
              If you do answer, you will fall to your death.

              The hermit lifted up his fist.

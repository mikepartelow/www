            The priest Hsiang-yen said, "It is as though you were up in a tree hanging from a branch by your teeth. You hands grasp no branch, your feet rest on no limb. 

          <p>
            Someone approaches underneath the tree and asks, 'What is the meaning of Bodhidharma's coming from the West?'

          <p>
            If you don't answer, you shirk your duty.

          <p>
            If you do answer, you will fall to your death.

          <p>
